    If one day you feel like crying...
　　Call me.
　　I don’t promise that I will make you laugh,
　　But I can cry with you.
　　If one day you want to run away — 
　　Don’t be afraid to call me.
　  I don’t promise to ask you to stop...
　  But I can run with you.
　　If one day you don’t want to listen to anyone...
　　Call me.
　　I promise to be there for you,
　 And I promise to be very quiet.
　　But if one day you call...
　　And there is no answer...
　　Come fast to see me,
 　Perhaps I need you.
