: 这几天看了好几次，每次都特感动。
: 总结了一下最喜欢的几句台词：
: Hoot: When I get home people \'ll ask me, "Hey Hoot, why do ya do it man? Why? Just some war junkie?" Ya know what I\'ll say? I won\'t say a goddamn word. Why? They won\'t understand. They won\'t understand why we do it. They won\'t understand that it\'s about the men next to you, and that\'s it. That\'s all it is.
