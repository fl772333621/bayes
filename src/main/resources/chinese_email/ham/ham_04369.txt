well i wonder could it be
when i was dreaming about you baby
you were dreaming of me
call me crazy
call me blind
to still be suffering is stupid after all of this time
did i lose my love to someone better
and does she love you like i do
i do, you know i really really do
well hey
so much i need to say
been lonely since the day
the day you went away
so sad but true
for me there\'s only you
been crying since the day
the day you went away
i remember date and time
september twenty second
sunday twenty five after nine
in the doorway with your case
no longer shouting at each other
there were tears on our faces
and we were letting go of something special
something we\'ll never have again
i know, i guess i really really know
why do we never know what we\'ve got till it\'s gone
how could i carry on the day you went away
cause i\'ve been missing you so much i have to say
每天深夜写东西的时候怎么老听这种歌
