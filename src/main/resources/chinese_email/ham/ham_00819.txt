Elvis Presley - One Night
(words &amp; music by D. Bartholomew - P. King)
One night with you
Is what I\'m now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
Just call my name
And I\'ll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My loves too strong to hide
Always lived, very quiet life
I ain\'t never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
One night with you
Is what I\'m now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
Always lived, very quiet life
I ain\'t never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
One night with you
Is what I\'m now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
