Jake Gittes: 
So there\'s this guy Walsh, do you understand? 
He\'s tired of screwin\' his wife... So his friend says to him, 
"Hey, why don\'t you do it like the Chinese do?" So he says, 
"How do the Chinese do it?" And the guy says, 
"Well, the Chinese, first they screw a little bit, then they stop, 
then they go and read a little Confucius, come back, 
screw a little bit more, then they stop again, 
go and they screw a little bit... then they go back and they screw 
a little bit more and then they go out and they contemplate 
the moon or something like that. Makes it more exciting." 
So now, the guy goes home and he starts screwin\' his own wife, see. 
So he screws her for a little bit and then he stops, and he goes out
 of the room and reads Life Magazine. Then he goes back in, 
he starts screwin\' again. He says, "Excuse me for a minute, honey." 
He goes out and he smokes a cigarette. Now his wife is gettin\' sore 
as hell. He comes back in the room, he starts screwin\' again. 
He gets up to start to leave again to go look at the moon. 
She looks at him and says, "Hey, whats the matter with ya. 
You\'re screwin\' just like a Chinaman!" 
[Laughs hysterically]
