不是，美国的税率是累进制。
$0 $7,300               10% of the amount over $0 
$7,300 $29,700          $730 plus 15% of the amount over 7,300 
$29,700 $71,950         $4,090.00 plus 25% of the amount over 29,700 
$71,950 $150,150        $14,652.50 plus 28% of the amount over 71,950 
$150,150 $326,450       $36,548.50 plus 33% of the amount over 150,150 
$326,450 no limit       $94,727.50 plus 35% of the amount over 326,450
From this table, you can see only those income above $326,450
will be taxed at the maxium rate 35%. All other incomes are taxed
well bellow 35%. 
: 我一直认为H1要交36%的税的
: 难道不是吗？
