Of course, these stats only focus on American and European movies. There\'s a 
great, big world of filmmaking out there, and India\'s Bollywood film industry is
 the most productive on the planet. India made a record of 948 movies in just 
one year, 1990, and Indian actors regularly make more movies than Hollywood 
actors. 
If you\'re looking for the actor who had the most leading roles in films, 
Guinness World Records lists John Wayne as tops. The Duke was the leading man in
 142 movies.
